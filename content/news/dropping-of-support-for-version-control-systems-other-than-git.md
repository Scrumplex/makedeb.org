makedeb plans to drop support for version control systems other than Git on April 6, 2022.

This is due to the lack of any seen usage of version control systems outside of Git.

Support for anything other than Git hasn't ever been officially recognized by makedeb in the first place, but the lack of observation in anyone using it has continued to lead to this decision.

Users who object to this decision can make a comment on the related [GitHub issue](https://github.com/makedeb/makedeb/issues/127). If no remarking concerns are made by April 6, support will be officially dropped.
