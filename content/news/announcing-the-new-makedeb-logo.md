The makedeb project now has a new logo! This is the result of a long decision which ended in the thought that the old logo felt out of place and not modern in general, and that a new one needed to take its place.

You can find the new logo on all of makedeb's websites. Updated branding assets can be found in the [branding repository on GitHub](https://github.com/makedeb/brand).
