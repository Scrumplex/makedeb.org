Package maintainers on the MPR can now get automatic updates for when their packages go out of date.

The new service is powered by [Repology](https://repology.org/), which is used in the backend to check the status of any given MPR package being out of date.

This should help maintainers always ensure that their packages are up to date, such as if they maintain a lot of packages or have other projects that make them unable to always focus on packaging.

To activate the new feature, visit the new `Integrations` tab on any package that you maintain.
