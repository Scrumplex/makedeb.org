After some setup has been completed, users are now able to start contributing translations to makedeb! :tada:

Translation support is being powered by the new [Weblate](https://weblate.makedeb.org) instance for makedeb. This will now serve as the website for all translations across the makedeb ecosystem, including the [MPR](https://mpr.makedeb.org) and [documentation](https://docs.makedeb.org).

Currently, only translations for makedeb itself are set up. You can start contributing translations for it at <https://weblate.makedeb.org/projects/makedeb/makedeb>.
